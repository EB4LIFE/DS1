Problem: Online Book Store
You are building a data structure for an online bookstore. The bookstore needs to support the following operations efficiently:
AddBook(ISBN, Title, Price) - Adds a new book to the collection. Each book is identified by a unique ISBN.
RemoveBook(ISBN) - Removes a book from the collection using its ISBN.
FindBook(ISBN) - Finds and returns the details (Title, Price) of a book using its ISBN.
UpdatePrice(ISBN, NewPrice) - Updates the price of a book identified by its ISBN.
ListAllBooksInRange(MinPrice, MaxPrice) - Lists all books with prices within a specified range [MinPrice, MaxPrice], sorted by price.
Requirements:
The AddBook, RemoveBook, FindBook, and UpdatePrice operations should be efficient, ideally O(log n).
The ListAllBooksInRange operation should be efficient and ideally list the books in O(k + log n) time, where k is the number of books in the range.
